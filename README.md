This project is a dynamic and interactive Stepper Component built using Vue 3 with the Options API. The stepper provides a guided user experience with three steps, ensuring validations at each stage before progressing to the next step. The project is ideal for scenarios like payment processing, multi-step forms, or any other sequential workflow in web applications.
